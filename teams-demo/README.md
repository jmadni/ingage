This demo project uses Microsoft Graph API to fetch user details and display user information.
It also has a page for viewing and creating Notebooks in OneNote cloud with Microsoft Graph API.
There are many other endpoints we can explore within the API(like Teams endpoints for work accounts), the steps of integration for all of them is the same.
